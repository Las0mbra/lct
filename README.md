# LCT - 40k TTS Base

A lightweight and actively maintained base for Warhammer 40k Tabletop Simulator maps, focused on gameplay clarity and quality-of-life improvements.

This project is a fork of Hutber’s FTC table (shared with permission), building on that strong foundation with additional features, refinements, and a slightly different design direction.

The aim of this fork is to provide a clean, self-contained experience while continuing to iterate on usability and tooling for both players and developers.

## Features

- VP/CP overlay for easier score tracking  
- Improved chess clock  
- Expanded dice functionality (including D3 support and quick right-click rolling)  
- Cleaner handling of drawn lines and bubble elements  
- Streamlined and simplified UI  
- Removal of unused UI components  
- Developer-friendly PowerShell compiler improvements  

Some integrations have also been adjusted to keep the project more self-contained.

Dynamic map generation (based on missions) is not yet implemented, but is currently in active development.

## Development

To run the compiler via Python, execute the following from the `Compiler` folder:

```bash
python3 compile.py --test
